DESCRIPTION
    This module provides two functions, nums2words and <nums2words_simple>,
    to convert number to Indonesian verbage. Popular Indonesian term for
    this kind of library is "terbilang", or roughly "spelled amount" in
    English.

FUNCTIONS
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  nums2words(NUM) => STR
    Convert number to Indonesian verbage (like converting 123 to "a hundred
    and twenty three" in English). Currently can handle real numbers in
    normal and scientific form in the order of hundreds of trillions. It
    also preserves formatting in the number string (e.g, given "1.00"
    nums2words will pronounce the zeros).

  nums2words_simple(NUM) => STR
    Like nums2words, but only pronounce the digits (like converting 123 to
    "one two three" in English).
